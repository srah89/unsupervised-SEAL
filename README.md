SEAL (**Se**lf-**A**dapting **L**LMs) is a framework for training language models via RL to generate self-edits (finetuning data and other update directives for themselves) in response to new inputs. 

We explore SEAL in two domains:
- [knowledge-incorporation](knowledge-incorporation): Incorporating new factual knowledge
- [few-shot](few-shot): Adapting to new tasks from few-shot examples

Both folders include code, data, and documentation.
